# Fake-News-Detection
Internship

## Overview  
This project focuses on building a **Fake News Detection** system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  
The goal is to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** based on their textual content, helping curb misinformation spread on digital platforms.

## üìÇ Dataset  
- Secondary dataset sourced from **Kaggle Fake News Dataset**  
- Contains **news articles with title, text, subject, and label**  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology  
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization  
- **Feature Extraction:** Applied **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform text into numerical features  
- **Model Training:** Used **Logistic Regression** as the baseline classifier  
- **Evaluation:** Measured performance using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix**
